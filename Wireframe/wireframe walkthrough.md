# 🧭 A Guide to Your Wireframes

### ✨ Designing Your Podcast App with User Stories in Mind

These wireframes are here to help you—think of them as a friendly map, not strict instructions. They give you a sense of layout, structure, and flow, but you are absolutely encouraged to bring your own creativity and design ideas into the final product.

Just like any real-world app, good design isn't about copying exactly—it's about building something that works well for your users. So while these images show you one way of organising the screens, your job is to _translate the user stories into great user experiences_, even if your design looks different.

### 📱 Mobile is Yours to Design

The wireframes we've provided are for desktop view only. How your app behaves on mobile is entirely up to you—and it's an important part of creating a production-ready app. Think about what your user will need on a smaller screen: what can be simplified, stacked, collapsed, or hidden behind a menu? This is your opportunity to show thoughtful, responsive design. Use media queries, flexbox/grid, or utility-first frameworks like Tailwind to adapt your layout—and make it feel seamless no matter the device.

# 💡 How to Use These Wireframes

- **Structure first, styling later:** Focus on layout and user flow before worrying about colours or animations.
- **Stay true to the user stories:** Every feature you add or change should tie back to something a user needs to do.
- **Responsiveness matters:** Whether you follow the exact layout or not, always make sure your design works across screen sizes.
- **You’re the designer:** Feel free to move sections around, add creative visual elements, or even change the navigation—as long as your app remains clear and usable.

# 🔊 Global Audio Player

🖼 _\[Global Audio Player wireframe]_
The wireframe shows a persistent player fixed at the bottom of the screen, with play/pause, seek, and duration info. It continues playback across pages. You don’t need to stick to the exact look—but your user should always be able to control audio from anywhere in the app.

# ❤️ Favourites Page

🖼 _\[Favourites Page wireframe]_
This view helps users see and manage their favourited episodes. You’ll want to include the basics: heart icons for favouriting, a list of saved episodes grouped by show, and sorting options. You can redesign the cards or layout as you like—just make sure it’s intuitive and helpful for your user.

# 🎠 Recommended Shows Carousel

🖼 _\[Recommended Shows wireframe]_
The carousel shows a horizontally scrollable list of shows to explore. This is a great space to add personality—think about hover effects, arrow controls, or swipe support. Just make sure the carousel links cleanly to the show's detail page.

# 🌗 Theme Toggle

🖼 _\[Theme Toggle wireframe]_
Switching between light and dark mode is now common in modern apps. Your toggle can be a button, switch, or even an icon-only toggle. The key part is that it works across all pages and remembers the user’s choice.

# 🔓 Final Tip: Your Project, Your Stamp

This is your chance to apply what you’ve learned to a real-world app. Coaches aren’t looking for how closely you matched the wireframes—they’re looking for _how well you implemented the features_ and _how clearly you thought through your design decisions_.

Trust your instincts. Follow the user stories. Build something you're proud of.

You’ve got this. 💪🎧
